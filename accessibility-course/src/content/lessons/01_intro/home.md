I believe accessibility shouldn’t be an afterthought—it should be part of the foundation of any project. But it’s hard to prioritize something you haven’t been taught. That’s why I built this course: to give you a solid grounding in the basics of web accessibility.

Throughout the course, you’ll explore real-world examples, build empathy for users with different needs, and develop the skills to make your websites usable for everyone. I’ll walk you through key concepts like alt text, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, and assistive technology—all in digestible lessons designed to help you grow your confidence.

## Why Listen to Me?

<!-- circle picture of me -->

I worked as a Digital Accessibility Specialist at BYU–Idaho for years helping the campus community make online content more accessible. That experience, combined with my degree in web development, is what shaped this course.

I know what it’s like to feel overwhelmed by accessibility—or to not even know where to start. This course is here to change that. I’ve seen the difference accessible code can make, and I want to help you build those skills from the ground up.
