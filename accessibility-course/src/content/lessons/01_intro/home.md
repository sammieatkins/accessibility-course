At Root, we believe accessibility shouldn't be an afterthought—it should be part of the foundation. In other words, it should be considered from the very beginning of your project. Accessibility isn't just a checkbox at the end of your build; it's something you grow into your code from the start.

But we also understand that it’s hard to prioritize something you haven’t been taught. That’s why we built this course—to give you a solid grounding in the basics of web accessibility. From the meaning behind WCAG guidelines to hands-on coding activities, you'll learn not just the what, but the why behind accessible development.

Throughout the course, you'll explore real-world examples, build empathy for users with different needs, and develop the skills to make your websites usable for everyone. We’ll walk you through key concepts like alt text, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, and assistive technology—all in digestible lessons designed to help you grow with confidence.

Let’s build a web that includes everyone—from the root up.
