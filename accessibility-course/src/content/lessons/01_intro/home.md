<h2 class="subheading" id="root-subheading">Web development grounded in accessibility</h2>

I believe accessibility shouldn’t be an afterthought—it should be part of the foundation of any project. But it’s hard to prioritize something you haven’t been taught. That’s why I built this course: to give you a solid grounding in the basics of web accessibility.

Throughout the course, you’ll explore real-world examples, build empathy for users with different needs, and develop the skills to make your websites usable for everyone. I’ll walk you through key concepts like alt text, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, and assistive technology—all in digestible lessons designed to help you grow your confidence.
