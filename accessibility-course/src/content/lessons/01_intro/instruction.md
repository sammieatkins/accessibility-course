# Introduction to Accessibility
<h2 class="subheading">So, what's the big deal?</h2>
If you're here, I'm assuming you care at least a little bit about accessibility—or maybe this is just a required course for your class. Either way, the purpose of this first lesson is to solidify for you why we should even bother making the web accessible.

## What is Accessibility?
Before we can get into the "why" of accessibility, I've got to make sure you know what I'm even talking about. In general, accessibility is about ensuring everyone can use things with an equal level of ease. In the context of web accessibility, that means we need to ensure our websites are coded in a way that allows all kinds of users to interpret the content on our sites. I'll get into what I mean by "all kinds of users" later on in this course.

## Why Does Accessibility Matter?
#### Accessibility Helps Everyone
While accessibility is intended to help people with disabilities specifically, accessible design improves usability for all users. I've got a few examples to illustrate this point.

#### Curb Cutting
Now, this example isn't specific to the web, but stay with me.
Curb cutting is when cities began adding ramps to sidewalks to make them accessible to wheelchair users. This happened because disability advocates fought to make public spaces usable for everyone. But it turns out, wheelchair users weren't the only people who benefitted. Parents pushing strollers, delivery drivers with carts, cyclists, and even skateboarders realized these ramps made their lives easier too. This idea is called the "curb-cut effect," and it applies to digital accessibility as well.

#### Digital Examples
Curb cuts are great, but let's bring it back to the web:

- Closed captions were originally created for deaf or hard-of-hearing viewers. But they're also handy when you're watching a video in a noisy environment, like a busy café, or a quiet one, like a library. They're even helpful if you're learning a new language.
- Text zooming isn't only beneficial for people with low vision. Ever try reading tiny text on a phone screen or viewing a detailed diagram that was way too small? Zooming helps you too.

#### It's About People, Not Just Code
<!-- fix this example: because it's not accessible -->
The web was built to be universal—a place where anyone, anywhere, can get information or interact without barriers. By choosing accessibility, you're actively including people who might otherwise be left out entirely. Imagine trying to apply for your dream job, but the website won't let you submit your application because it's not accessible. Or maybe you just want to order dinner online, but the site is impossible to navigate without a mouse. Accessibility means building the web we ourselves would want to use—one where nobody is locked out by poor design.

#### Legal Implications
If all that talk about empathy and morals didn't fully convince you, let's talk practical reasons. Accessibility isn’t just a nice-to-have—it's required by law in many countries. For instance, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508 mandate accessible digital experiences in the United States. Globally, many countries base their accessibility standards on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Companies that ignore these requirements face real legal risks, from expensive lawsuits to damaged reputations. Simply put, ignoring accessibility is risky.

#### Career Benefits
<!-- talk about how most major companies (aka, the ones that will pay you well) (idk about that joke lol) expect their developers to produce accessible code -->
<!-- companies also care a lot about SEO (search engine optimization). go into the details of how coding with accessibility in mind spills over into seo benefits -->
Most major companies—yep, especially those bigger companies you've probably heard of—expect their developers to produce accessible code. Having accessibility skills makes you more employable and signals to potential employers that you care about building quality products.

Additionally, companies love SEO (search engine optimization), because SEO translates directly to higher visibility online. Conveniently, coding with accessibility in mind naturally improves SEO: semantic HTML, clear headings, descriptive alt text, and organized content structure all contribute directly to better search rankings. So, if empathy and legal requirements weren't quite enough motivation, just know that being accessibility-savvy literally makes you more marketable.

## The Elephant in the Room
I know accessibility might feel challenging or like "extra work," especially if you're used to just getting your page up quickly. Honestly, I've been there. But here's what I've learned: accessibility is only "extra work" when you tack it on at the end. If you learn to integrate accessibility from the start, it becomes second nature. Remember when you first learned to comment your code or keep your CSS organized? At first, it probably felt tedious, but now you do it automatically. Accessibility can—and should—be the same way.
<!-- workshop those examples? devs hate these already -->
<!-- keyboard shortcuts? -->

That's why this course is called "Root"—it's about grounding your web development practices in accessibility from the very beginning. Accessibility shouldn't be a separate branch you add later; it should be the foundation your code grows from.

<!-- workshop to pull from this: The web was built to be universal—a place where anyone, anywhere, can get information or interact without barriers. -->
I promise you, the community advocating for more accessible websites isn't really asking for much. They're just asking us to use the web how it was intended: an inclusive platform designed to be accessible in its own right. We just have to code properly.
<!-- cut We just have to code properly. - feels passive aggressive. same idea, just less accusatory -->

My goal for this course is to help you see accessibility not as an obligation, but as a natural part of writing clean, quality code—because honestly, it's something worth caring about.
