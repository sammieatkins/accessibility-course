# Assistive Technology
<h2 class="subheading">[subhead]</h2>

<!-- a heading level for each assistive technology. including whta they are and how and why they are used and how the student taking the course can implment them (maybe that bit goes in the activities?) -->
<!-- personas for the people who use these assistive technologies -->
<!-- why know about these and how to use them? -->
<!-- ans: need to be able to test yourself AS YOU GO so that you can output accessible code. easier to tweak throughout than at the end when you have a functioning product and think you're "done" -->
<!-- WebAIM breakdown of assitive tech usage - link for light reading -->
<!-- also include cognitie disabilities -->
