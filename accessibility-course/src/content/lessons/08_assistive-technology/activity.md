# Assistive Technology Practice

In this activity, you’ll try using real assistive technologies to navigate a website—ideally one you’ve built. You’re welcome to test this course site too if that’s easier. This isn’t about doing everything perfectly. It’s about seeing the web through someone else’s tools and noticing where things break, disappear, or just get weird. Because that’s the stuff real users run into every day.

> **Pro tip:** Assistive tech can feel a little chaotic the first time you use it. That’s normal. Before you turn anything on, make sure you know how to turn it _off_.

## First: How to Turn Things Off

Before we get going, here’s how to exit each tool safely:

- **VoiceOver (macOS):** `Command + F5`
- **Narrator (Windows):** `Control + Windows + Enter`
- **Voice Access (Windows):** Say “Voice Access sleep” or toggle from the mic icon
- **Voice Access (Android):** Say “Stop Voice Access” or tap the blue microphone
- **Screen readers on iOS/Android:** Triple-click the side/home button or toggle in settings

## Keyboard Navigation

This is the foundation. Before you touch screen readers or voice tools, make sure your site actually works without a mouse.

### Try this:

- Press `Tab` to move forward through interactive elements
- Press `Shift + Tab` to go backward
- Use `Enter` or `Space` to activate focused items
- Use `arrow keys` to navigate menus, radio groups, sliders, or `select` dropdowns

### Watch for:

- Can you see where you are on the page? (that's called a **focus indicator**)
- Can you interact with everything?
- Do dropdowns, menus, and modals work?
- Can you use arrow keys to make selections where needed?
- Do you ever get trapped?

## Screen Readers

Time to listen. Screen readers speak the content of a page aloud, using keyboard commands (or gestures on mobile) to move through it.

### Try this:

Choose your device:

- **Mac:** `Command + F5` to turn on VoiceOver
- **Windows:** `Control + Windows + Enter` to turn on Narrator
- **iPhone:** Triple-click the side button (or enable in Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver)
- **Android:** Enable TalkBack in Accessibility settings

Then:

- Use arrow keys (desktop) or swipe gestures (mobile) to explore
- Try tabbing through buttons and links
- Listen closely to how the site is described

### Watch for:

- Does the page make sense in audio form?
- Do buttons and links have useful names?
- Are headings used consistently?
- Is anything skipped or confusing?

## Voice Access

Voice control software lets users interact with a page by saying commands out loud.

### Try this:

If you're on:

- **Windows:** Turn on Voice Access from Accessibility settings (`Windows + Control + N`)
- **Android:** Install the Voice Access app and toggle it on

Then try saying:

- “Click [link or button name]”
- “Scroll down”
- “Show numbers”
- “Click [number]”

### Watch for:

- Can you reach everything by speaking?
- Are your links and buttons clearly labeled?
- Does your content respond to voice commands?

## Wrap-Up

Testing your site with real assistive tech might feel clunky, slow, or overwhelming at first—and that’s the point. These tools reveal all the places where a site either _works beautifully_ or _completely falls apart_. You don’t need to get it all right today. You just need to get familiar, and keep trying.
