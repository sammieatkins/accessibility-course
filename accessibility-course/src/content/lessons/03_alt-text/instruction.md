# Alt Text
<h2 class="subheading">It's more than just 'dog.jpg'</h2>
Alt text is probably somehting you already think you know about accessibility. Most developers know about alt text because it's one of the default attributes in an `img` tag when you use emmet shortcuts. Alt text short for alternative text. It's meant to be an equivalent alternative to a meaningful image that helps people who can’t see it understand what it shows.

## How to Write Alt Text

1. What Is Alt Text?
A friendly definition: “Alt text” is short for alternative text—a description of an image that helps people who can’t see it understand what it shows.

Where it goes: Inside the alt="" attribute in HTML.

Usual length: ~250 characters or less.

2. Why Alt Text Matters
Empathy + impact: Helps screen reader users understand visuals.

Helps people with slow connections, broken images, and more.

Makes your site more inclusive, accessible, and useful for everyone.

3. What Alt Text Is NOT
Not a caption.

Not a filename (e.g., “dog.jpg” ❌).

Not just “Image” or “Picture of…”.

Not filler or decorative fluff.

Not copy-pasted from the image title or surrounding text.

(You can bring in that Thompson list here if you like!)

4. How to Know What to Write
Focus on purpose and context.

Ask: What would someone miss if they couldn’t see this image?

Different context = different alt text (give examples, like the dog on a pet site vs. a dog breed quiz).

5. What About Decorative Images?
If it’s just visual flair (no useful info), use alt="".

This tells screen readers to skip it—very helpful!

Examples: borders, patterns, icons that are repeated elsewhere in text.

6. Alt Text for Functional Images
If the image does something (like a button or link), describe its function, not its appearance.

Example: A logo that links to the homepage → alt="Home", not “Blue and white dog logo”.
