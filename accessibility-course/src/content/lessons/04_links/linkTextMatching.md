# Link Text Matching Activity
Let’s see how well link text actually communicates where it leads.

## What You’ll Do:
In this activity, you’ll be given a piece of link text—the part users would click on—and a list of possible destination URLs. Your job is to choose the destination that makes the most sense based on the link text alone.

Each option is shown as a relative path (like /about or /register) rather than a full URL. Imagine these are part of a real site, and you're deciding where that link would—or should—take you.

After you make your choice, we’ll show you what the correct answer was and explain why it worked (or why it didn’t). There’s no trick, no penalty for a wrong answer—just a chance to sharpen your instincts.
