<!-- lists => description, ordered, unordered (when to use each) -->
<!-- tables => table captions (optional, but helpful for complex tables), th tags, NOT for layout, etc. -->
<!-- talk about tags like <aside> and <nav> and others. especially ones that can easily replace <div> for a more semantic alternative. -->
<!-- link to some big list of html tags? maybe w3schools has one -->
