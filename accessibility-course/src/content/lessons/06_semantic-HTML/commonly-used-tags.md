# Commonly Used Tags

This is a list of HTML tags I’ve compiled. It’s not meant to be exhaustive, and yes—some of these are the basics everyone knows. But others are more niche, surprisingly useful, or just plain cool. Some get forgotten about even though they can really come in handy.

You can always check out the full list at [W3Schools: HTML Tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp).
