# Heading Levels Practice

In this activity, you'll look at different parts of an article and decide what heading level is the most appropriate for each section.

## Here's how it works:
- For each block of content, select the appropriate heading level from the dropdown.
- You’ll get instant feedback after you check your answers—including explanations to help you understand the correct structure.
- If you want to try again, hit “Restart Activity” and give it another go.

When you finish and check your answers, the page will scroll and focus back to the top so you can review your results.

And don’t worry—this isn’t about memorizing the difference between h3 and h4. It’s about learning how to think in levels.
