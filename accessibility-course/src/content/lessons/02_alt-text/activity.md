# Alt Text Practice

You’ve learned the principles—now it’s time to put them into action. This activity gives you a chance to practice writing alt text that actually helps users.

## What You’ll Do:

For each example, you’ll see:

1. An image
2. A short blurb of surrounding content—this is your context. Imagine it’s part of a real article, post, or presentation. What would a user miss if they couldn’t see the image?
3. Your job is to write alt text that fits the purpose of the image in that specific situation. Don’t just describe what you see—describe what it adds to the content.

## A Few Reminders Before You Start:

- **Context is everything.** Your alt text should reflect what the image communicates in that particular setting.
- **Be concise**. One clear sentence (around 125 characters or fewer) is usually enough.
- **Skip the obvious.** No need to say “image of…”—screen readers already know it’s an image.
- **Only describe what’s visually there.** Don’t reveal information the image doesn’t show (especially if it’s part of a quiz or test).

<div class="important-callout">
  <img src="/images/icon_eyes_right.png" alt="" class="icon-eyes" />
  <div>
    <h2 class="important-heading">Important</h2>
    <div class="important-content">
      <p>
        All of the images in this activity are meaningful—none of them are decorative. Each one is included for a reason, and your alt text should help users understand that reason.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Once you submit your description, you’ll see an example answer and have a chance to reflect before moving on.
