# Accessible Color Palette Tester

Good design isn’t just about looking nice—it needs to work for everyone.
In this activity, you’ll adjust colors for text, buttons, and links to
see how contrast affects readability. The preview updates as you make
changes, so any color combinations that don’t meet WCAG standards will
be flagged. Experiment with different options, find a fully accessible
palette, and export your colors as CSS variables to use in your own
projects.
