# Testing
<h2 class="subheading">[subhead]</h2>

<!-- now that we've talked about assistive technology and learned a bit about how to use it, let's use it to test our sites -->
<!-- go through all the testing methods outlined -->
<!-- other testing tools: ANDI, WAVE (show custom keyboard shortcut), Accessibility Insights, Lighthouse, etc. -->
<!-- manual testing => NECESSARY -->
<!-- how to test -->
<!-- why test: duh. how else do you know your code is accessible? it's the same as testing to see if a program works. while you test something for functionality, also give it a cursory check with some automatic tools. talk about attaching new habits to existing ones as a good strategy for learning. also, once you buy in to the [other lessons], your code will be largely accessible as you go. -->

<!-- random idea: generate an AI prompt that will teach a chat to give you accessible code? that could be interesting... probably not enough data to pull from with ARIA. but maybe could be taught by giving it reliable sources that teach about ARIA. -->
