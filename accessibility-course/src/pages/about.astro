<!-- this was my capstone project for my web design and development degree, and i think it's the perfect culmination of my time at BYUI. i developed a love of teaching by being a web development TA and I became passionate about web accessibility through my job at accessibility services on campus as a digital accessibility specialist. This course represents everything I lvoe about web development, good design, etc, etc.-->
