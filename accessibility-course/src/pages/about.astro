        This course was my capstone project for the Web Design and Development
        degree at BYU–Idaho, and I honestly can’t imagine a better way to close
        out this chapter. It brings together everything I care about: clean
        code, thoughtful design, and teaching others how to build the web the
        right way.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        I first got into accessibility through my job as a Digital Accessibility
        Specialist for BYU–Idaho’s Disability Services office. That job
        completely changed how I think about the web. It’s one thing to know the
        rules—like how to use semantic HTML or write alt text—but it’s another
        thing entirely to see how those decisions directly impact someone’s daily life.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        While working there, I also spent time as a TA for web development
        classes, and I discovered how much I love helping others learn to code.
        That experience is what pushed me to create a course that doesn’t just
        check boxes—it actually helps you understand why accessibility matters
        and how to build with it in mind from the start.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Everything in this course is here because I believe web accessibility
        isn’t extra—it’s essential. Whether you're brand new to coding or just
        need a refresher, my goal is to give you practical, approachable tools
        to start building more inclusive websites.

        Thanks for being here.

<!-- this was my capstone project for my web design and development degree, and i think it's the perfect culmination of my time at BYUI. i developed a love of teaching by being a web development TA and I became passionate about web accessibility through my job at accessibility services on campus as a digital accessibility specialist. This course represents everything I lvoe about web development, good design, etc, etc.-->
